- ✅ `BrowserOptions` dataclass defined
- ✅ `TestResult` dataclass defined
- ✅ `TokenMetrics` dataclass defined
- ✅ `OptimizationMetrics` dataclass defined

**What's Missing**:
- ❌ Models not yet integrated into core.py

- ✅ `get_model_metadata()` method with fallback context limits
- ✅ `estimate_cost()` method for token pricing
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling (ProviderError, ModelNotFoundError, ConfigurationError)
- ✅ Dynamic configuration support (temperature, max_tokens)
- ✅ Logging integrated

**What's Missing**:
- ❌ Not integrated into BrowserPilot
- ❌ No unit tests

## Phase 2: Core Components (Week 1-2)

### ✅ Task 2.1: Implement BrowserConfigBuilder
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**What's Done**:
- ✅ File created: `browser_config.py`
- ✅ Full implementation with browser validation
- ✅ `build_mcp_args()` with all browser options
- ✅ `create_session_directory()` for artifact storage
- ✅ `get_server_params()` for MCP integration
- ✅ Browser aliases mapping (chrome->chromium, etc.)
- ✅ Comprehensive argument building for all features

**What's Missing**:
- ❌ Not integrated into BrowserPilot
- ❌ No unit tests

### ✅ Task 2.2: Implement PromptBuilder
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**What's Done**:
- ✅ File created: `prompt_builder.py`
- ✅ Full implementation with DEFAULT_INSTRUCTIONS
- ✅ `build()` method for prompt construction
- ✅ `optimize()` method with TokenOptimizer integration
- ✅ `extract_test_name()` for test identification
- ✅ Browser-specific instructions for forms
- ✅ Report template integrated

**What's Missing**:
- ❌ Not integrated into BrowserPilot
- ❌ No unit tests

### ✅ Task 2.3: Implement TestExecutor
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**What's Done**:
- ✅ File created: `test_executor.py`
- ✅ Full async implementation with streaming
- ✅ `execute()` method with timeout support
- ✅ `_execute_stream()` for agent interaction
- ✅ `_process_chunk()` for step extraction
- ✅ `_determine_success()` for result analysis
- ✅ Verbose mode support with progress indicators
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

**What's Missing**:
- ❌ Not integrated into BrowserPilot
- ❌ No unit tests

## Phase 3: Analysis Components (Week 2)

### ⚠️ Task 3.1: Implement ResultAnalyzer
**Status**: STRUCTURE ONLY  
- ✅ File created: `result_analyzer.py`
- ❌ Implementation pending
- ❌ Tests pending

### ⚠️ Task 3.2: Implement TokenMetricsCollector
**Status**: STRUCTURE ONLY  
- ✅ File created: `token_metrics.py`
- ❌ Implementation pending
- ❌ Tests pending

## Phase 4: Integration (Week 2-3)

### ❌ Task 4.1: Refactor BrowserPilot - Part 1
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
- Core.py still named BrowserPilot (should be BrowserCopilot)
- No component imports
- Original structure intact

### ❌ Task 4.2: Refactor BrowserPilot - Part 2
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
- Dependent on Task 4.1

### ❌ Task 4.3: Integration Testing
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
- Dependent on Tasks 4.1 and 4.2

## Phase 5: Cleanup and Documentation (Week 3)

### ❌ All Phase 5 Tasks
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
- Dependent on Phase 4 completion

## Phase 6: Advanced Features (Week 4)

### ❌ All Phase 6 Tasks
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
- Low priority, dependent on earlier phases

## Key Findings

### What's Been Done:
1. **Component Structure**: All files created
2. **Data Models**: All defined but not integrated
3. **LLMManager**: Partially implemented
4. **File Organization**: Good structure in place

### What's Still Needed:
1. **Implementation**: Most components are empty shells
2. **Integration**: Components not used by core.py
3. **Testing**: No tests for any components
4. **Migration**: BrowserPilot hasn't been refactored

### Critical Path Items:
1. **Complete component implementations** (Phase 2)
2. **Integrate with core.py** (Phase 4)
3. **Write comprehensive tests**
4. **Update documentation**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Complete Task 1.2**: Finish data model integration
2. **Implement Task 2.1**: BrowserConfigBuilder (high priority)
3. **Implement Task 2.2**: PromptBuilder (high priority)
4. **Start writing tests immediately**

### Risk Areas:
1. **Integration complexity**: Refactoring core.py will be challenging
2. **Test coverage**: Currently 0% for new components
3. **Backward compatibility**: Must maintain existing API

### Time Estimate:
- **Original estimate**: 4 weeks
- **Revised estimate**: 3-4 weeks (better than expected progress)
- **Critical path**: Phase 4 integration is the next major milestone
- **Actual progress**: Ahead of schedule on component implementation

## Action Items

1. **Prioritize component implementation** over new features
2. **Write tests as you implement** (TDD approach)
3. **Consider incremental integration** rather than big-bang
4. **Update existing tests** to use new components
5. **Document as you go** to avoid technical debt
