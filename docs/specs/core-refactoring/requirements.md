# Core.py Refactoring Requirements

## 1. Overview

The `browser_copilot/core.py` file has grown to over 790 lines and violates several SOLID principles. This refactoring aims to decompose the monolithic `BrowserPilot` class into focused, testable components while maintaining backward compatibility.

## 2. Business Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

- **BR-1**: Maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing public API
- **BR-2**: Preserve all current functionality without regression
- **BR-3**: Support existing configuration and customization options
- **BR-4**: Maintain or improve performance characteristics
- **BR-5**: Keep the same error handling and reporting behavior

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-1**: Improve code maintainability (reduce cyclomatic complexity by 50%)
- **NFR-2**: Enhance testability (achieve 90%+ unit test coverage)
- **NFR-3**: Reduce coupling between components (max 3 dependencies per class)
- **NFR-4**: Improve readability (no method longer than 50 lines)
- **NFR-5**: Enable easier feature addition and modification

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Architecture Requirements

- **AR-1**: Follow Single Responsibility Principle for each component
- **AR-2**: Use dependency injection for component composition
- **AR-3**: Implement clear interfaces between components
- **AR-4**: Support async/await patterns consistently
- **AR-5**: Maintain thread safety where applicable

### 3.2 Code Quality Requirements

- **CQ-1**: Each component must have comprehensive docstrings
- **CQ-2**: Type hints required for all public methods
- **CQ-3**: Follow existing code style and conventions
- **CQ-4**: No circular dependencies between components
- **CQ-5**: Clear separation of concerns

### 3.3 Testing Requirements

- **TR-1**: Unit tests for each new component
- **TR-2**: Integration tests for component interactions
- **TR-3**: Regression tests for public API compatibility
- **TR-4**: Performance benchmarks to ensure no degradation
- **TR-5**: Mock-based tests for external dependencies

## 4. Constraints

### 4.1 Technical Constraints

- **TC-1**: Must use Python 3.10+ features appropriately
- **TC-2**: Cannot break existing integrations with ModelForge
- **TC-3**: Must maintain compatibility with MCP protocol
- **TC-4**: Cannot change the CLI interface
- **TC-5**: Must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### 4.2 Project Constraints

- **PC-1**: Refactoring must be completed incrementally
- **PC-2**: Each phase must pass all tests before proceeding
- **PC-3**: Documentation must be updated alongside code
- **PC-4**: Changes must be reviewable in reasonable-sized PRs

## 5. Success Criteria

### 5.1 Measurable Outcomes

- **MO-1**: Core.py reduced to under 200 lines
- **MO-2**: No single component exceeds 300 lines
- **MO-3**: Cyclomatic complexity per method ≤ 10
- **MO-4**: Test execution time remains within 10% of current
- **MO-5**: Memory usage does not increase by more than 5%

### 5.2 Quality Metrics

- **QM-1**: Code coverage ≥ 90% for new components
- **QM-2**: All public methods have docstrings
- **QM-3**: Zero high-severity linting issues
- **QM-4**: Maintainability index improves by 30%
- **QM-5**: No regression in existing functionality

## 6. Risks and Mitigations

### 6.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Breaking changes to public API | High | Low | Comprehensive test suite, careful API preservation |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Benchmark before/after, profile critical paths |
| Integration issues with dependencies | High | Low | Integration tests, staged rollout |
| Increased complexity from abstraction | Medium | Medium | Keep abstractions simple, document thoroughly |

### 6.2 Project Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Strict adherence to requirements, phased approach |
| Insufficient testing | High | Medium | Test-first development, coverage requirements |
| Documentation lag | Low | High | Update docs with each PR |

## 7. Dependencies

### 7.1 External Dependencies

- ModelForge for LLM integration
- MCP for browser automation protocol
- LangGraph for agent orchestration
- Existing test suites for validation

### 7.2 Internal Dependencies

- ConfigManager for configuration
- StreamHandler for output
- TokenOptimizer for prompt optimization
- VerboseLogger for debugging
