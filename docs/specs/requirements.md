# Browser Copilot Refactoring Requirements

## 1. Project Overview

This document defines the requirements for refactoring Browser Copilot to improve code quality, maintainability, and reliability while preserving all existing functionality.

## 2. Business Requirements

### 2.1 Goals
- **Improve Code Quality**: Elevate from B+ to A+ grade
- **Enhance Maintainability**: Reduce time to implement new features by 50%
- **Increase Reliability**: Achieve 99.9% test pass rate across all platforms
- **Better Developer Experience**: Make codebase easier to understand and modify

### 2.2 Constraints
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All public APIs must remain backward compatible
- **No Performance Degradation**: Execution time must not increase
- **Incremental Delivery**: Refactoring must be done in small, mergeable chunks
- **Continuous Operation**: No downtime or disruption to users

### 2.3 Success Criteria
- All functions < 50 lines of code
- All classes < 200 lines with < 7 public methods
- Cyclomatic complexity < 10 for all functions
- 95%+ test coverage on refactored code
- Zero regression bugs
- Windows CI tests passing consistently

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Error Handling (REFACTOR-001)
**Priority**: High

- **Current State**: Generic exceptions with limited context
- **Required State**: Domain-specific exceptions with context and suggestions
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - All exceptions inherit from BrowserPilotError
  - Every exception includes helpful error context
  - User-facing errors have actionable suggestions
  - No bare except blocks remain

### 3.2 Code Organization (REFACTOR-002)
**Priority**: High

- **Current State**: Large functions (483 lines), god objects
- **Required State**: Small, focused functions following SRP
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - run_test_async function < 50 lines
  - BrowserPilot class split into focused components
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Each class has single responsibility

### 3.3 Type Safety (REFACTOR-003)
**Priority**: Medium

- **Current State**: Repeated complex types, unclear interfaces
- **Required State**: Centralized type definitions with validation
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - All complex types defined as aliases
  - Runtime validation for critical types
  - 100% type coverage with mypy strict mode
  - No type: ignore comments

### 3.4 Resource Management (REFACTOR-004)
**Priority**: High

- **Current State**: Files/resources not properly cleaned up
- **Required State**: All resources use context managers
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - No file handles left open
  - All loggers properly closed
  - Windows file lock issues resolved
  - Memory leaks eliminated

### 3.5 Configuration (REFACTOR-005)
**Priority**: Medium

- **Current State**: Magic numbers and strings throughout code
- **Required State**: All constants centralized and named
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Zero magic numbers in code
  - All strings extracted to constants
  - Configuration values in one location
  - Constants are immutable

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
- Refactored code must not increase execution time by more than 5%
- Memory usage must not increase by more than 10%
- Startup time must remain under 2 seconds

### 4.2 Maintainability
- Code complexity metrics must improve by at least 40%
- New developer onboarding time reduced from 2 weeks to 1 week
- Time to fix bugs reduced by 50%

### 4.3 Testability
- All components must be independently testable
- Mock objects easily injectable
- Test execution time < 30 seconds for unit tests

### 4.4 Documentation
- All public APIs must have docstrings
- Architecture decisions documented
- Migration guide for each refactoring

### 4.5 Compatibility
- Python 3.11+ support maintained
- All OS platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) fully supported
- All existing CLI commands work identically

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Code Standards
- PEP 8 compliance
- Black formatting
- isort import ordering
- Type hints on all functions

### 5.2 Testing Standards
- TDD approach for all changes
- Unit tests for new components
- Integration tests for workflows
- No reduction in test coverage

### 5.3 Error Messages
- User-friendly language
- Include context about what went wrong
- Provide actionable next steps
- Log technical details separately

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1 Technical Dependencies
- Python 3.11+ (no change)
- All current dependencies maintained
- No new required dependencies

### 6.2 Process Dependencies
- Code review required for all changes
- CI/CD must pass before merge
- Documentation updates with code

## 7. Risks and Mitigation

### 7.1 Regression Risk
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite, incremental changes

### 7.2 Performance Risk
- **Risk**: Refactoring introduces slowdowns
- **Mitigation**: Performance benchmarks before/after

### 7.3 Adoption Risk
- **Risk**: Developers resist new patterns
- **Mitigation**: Clear documentation, gradual rollout

## 8. Acceptance Criteria Summary

- [ ] All 11 refactoring specifications implemented
- [ ] Zero regression bugs reported
- [ ] All metrics targets achieved
- [ ] Documentation fully updated
- [ ] Team trained on new patterns
- [ ] 30-day stability period with no issues

## 9. Out of Scope

- Adding new features
- Changing external APIs
- Modifying CLI interface
- Updating dependencies
- Performance optimizations beyond current levels

## 10. Sign-off

This requirements document must be reviewed and approved by:
- [ ] Lead Developer
- [ ] Project Maintainer
- [ ] QA Representative
