This document outlines the functional requirements for Browser Copilot MVP enhancements. These features are designed to improve debuggability, flexibility, and user experience for QA engineers using the tool for automated browser testing.

## Stakeholders

- **Primary Users**: QA Engineers, Test Automation Engineers
- **Secondary Users**: Developers, DevOps Engineers
- **Maintainers**: Browser Copilot Development Team

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Enhanced Verbose Mode

**ID**: REQ-001
**Priority**: High
**User Story**: As a QA engineer, I want to see detailed step-by-step execution information during test runs so that I can debug test failures and understand the AI agent's decision-making process.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When `--verbose` flag is enabled, system displays:
  - Each browser action being attempted (navigate, click, type, etc.)
  - MCP tool calls with parameters
  - AI agent's reasoning for each action
  - Page state before and after actions
  - Timing information for each step
- Verbose output is clearly formatted and timestamped
- Console shows color-coded, human-readable output
- Detailed logs are saved to ~/.browser_copilot/logs/test_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
- Log files contain structured JSON entries for parsing
- Performance impact is minimal (<10% execution time increase)

### 2. Comprehensive Test Reporting

**ID**: REQ-002
**Priority**: High
**User Story**: As a QA engineer, I want test reports to include timing and token usage data so that I can track test performance and costs.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Test reports include:
  - Test start timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
  - Test end timestamp
  - Total execution duration
  - Token usage breakdown (prompt, completion, total)
  - Estimated cost from ModelForge's TelemetryCallback
  - Cost breakdown by token type (prompt vs completion)
- Telemetry data is sourced from ModelForge's TelemetryCallback
- Cost calculations use ModelForge's built-in pricing data
- Reports maintain backward compatibility with existing format

### 3. Multiple Input Methods

**ID**: REQ-003
**Priority**: Medium
**User Story**: As a QA engineer, I want to provide test suites via stdin so that I can integrate Browser Copilot into CI/CD pipelines more easily.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System accepts test suite input from:
  - File path (existing functionality)
  - Standard input (stdin) when file path is "-" or omitted
- Stdin input supports the same Markdown format as file input
- Error handling for malformed input is consistent across methods
- Help text documents both input methods

### 4. System Prompt Customization

**ID**: REQ-004
**Priority**: Medium
**User Story**: As a QA engineer, I want to customize the system prompt so that I can adapt the AI agent's behavior for specific testing scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System accepts custom prompts via:
  - `--system-prompt` flag with inline text
  - `--system-prompt-file` flag with file path
- Custom prompts override default behavior
- System validates prompt format and length
- Default prompt is well-documented
- Custom prompts support template variables (browser, viewport, etc.)

### 5. Flexible Output Options

**ID**: REQ-005
**Priority**: Medium
**User Story**: As a QA engineer, I want to control where test reports are saved so that I can integrate with different logging systems.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `-o/--output` flag controls report destination:
  - Console output (default when flag not specified)
  - File path for saving reports
  - Directory path for automatic filename generation
- Output format remains consistent (Markdown)
- System creates parent directories if needed
- Error handling for write permissions

### 6. Smart Default Configuration

**ID**: REQ-006
**Priority**: High
**User Story**: As a QA engineer, I want Browser Copilot to use my existing ModelForge configuration by default so that I don't need to specify provider/model repeatedly.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- When `--provider` and `--model` not specified:
  - System reads current ModelForge configuration
  - Uses default/active model from ModelForge
  - Falls back to error if no configuration exists
- Explicit flags override ModelForge defaults
- Clear error messages guide configuration setup

### 7. Browser Selection Validation

**ID**: REQ-007
**Priority**: Low
**User Story**: As a QA engineer, I want clear browser options so that I know which browsers are supported.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `--browser` flag validates against supported browsers:
  - chromium (default)
  - firefox
  - webkit
- Invalid browser names produce helpful error messages
- Browser availability is checked before test execution
- Help text lists all supported browsers

### 8. Test Suite Enhancement Feature

**ID**: REQ-008
**Priority**: Low
**User Story**: As a QA engineer, I want to generate LLM-optimized test suites so that my tests run more reliably with AI agents.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `--enhance-test-suite` flag triggers enhancement mode
- System analyzes input test suite and generates:
  - More explicit action descriptions
  - Better element identifiers
  - Clearer success criteria
  - Structured step formatting
- Enhanced suite is saved to specified output
- Original test functionality is preserved
- Enhancement suggestions are documented

### 9. Authentication Flow Integration

**ID**: REQ-009
**Priority**: High
**User Story**: As a QA engineer, I want Browser Copilot to handle ModelForge authentication automatically so that I can start testing immediately.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System detects unauthenticated ModelForge state
- For providers requiring auth (e.g., github_copilot):
  - Automatically triggers device flow authentication
  - Displays clear instructions to user
  - Waits for authentication completion
  - Verifies authentication before proceeding
- Authentication errors are clearly communicated
- Process is documented in help text

### 10. Local Storage Management

**ID**: REQ-010
**Priority**: High
**User Story**: As a QA engineer, I want Browser Copilot to maintain local storage for logs, settings, and future features so that I can review past test runs and maintain consistent configuration.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Playwright MCP server for browser automation
- Existing Browser Copilot codebase

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Verbose output could expose sensitive data
   - **Mitigation**: Implement filtering for common patterns (passwords, tokens)

2. **Risk**: Custom prompts could break agent behavior
   - **Mitigation**: Validate prompts and provide fallback to default

3. **Risk**: Authentication flow could confuse users
   - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation and in-terminal guidance

4. **Risk**: Enhanced test suites might not improve reliability
   - **Mitigation**: Make feature optional and document best practices
