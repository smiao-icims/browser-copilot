# Data Models Phase 2 - Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines requirements for refactoring additional components to use strongly-typed data models instead of dictionaries. This is a continuation of the successful Phase 1 refactoring that introduced models for core test results.

## Goals

1. **Type Safety**: Replace `dict[str, Any]` with strongly-typed dataclasses
2. **Validation**: Move validation logic into model constructors/validators
3. **Documentation**: Use models as living documentation of data structures
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing APIs to prevent breaking changes
5. **Developer Experience**: Improve IDE support with auto-completion and type hints

## Components to Refactor

### 1. ConfigManager (Highest Priority)
- Currently uses nested dictionaries for configuration layers
- No type safety for configuration values
- Complex merging logic without structure guarantees

### 2. VerboseLogger (High Priority)
- Uses dictionaries for execution steps, tool calls, and metrics
- No structure enforcement for log entries
- Difficult to analyze logs programmatically

### 3. TokenOptimizer (Medium Priority)
- Returns optimization metrics as untyped dictionaries
- No guarantee of metric structure consistency
- Cost calculations lack type safety

### 4. Reporter (Medium Priority)
- Assumes dictionary structure throughout
- Already has BrowserTestResult model available
- Needs update to leverage existing models

### 5. WizardState (Low Priority)
- Already uses dataclass for main state
- Returns configuration as dictionary
- History entries are untyped

## Success Criteria

1. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing code continues to work
2. **100% Test Coverage**: All new models have comprehensive tests
3. **Type Safety**: Mypy passes in strict mode
4. **Performance**: No performance degradation
5. **Documentation**: All models have clear docstrings

## Constraints

1. Must maintain backward compatibility with existing APIs
2. Must follow patterns established in Phase 1
3. Must support serialization/deserialization
4. Must handle migration from old dict format
5. Must work on all supported platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Model creation should have minimal overhead
- Serialization should be efficient
- No memory leaks from circular references

### Maintainability
- Follow existing code style
- Use descriptive field names
- Group related models together
- Provide factory methods where helpful

### Testing
- Unit tests for all models
- Property-based tests with Hypothesis
- Serialization round-trip tests
- Backward compatibility tests
- Migration tests from dict format

## Implementation Order

1. **ConfigManager**: Highest impact, used throughout system
2. **VerboseLogger**: Critical for debugging and monitoring
3. **TokenOptimizer**: Important for cost tracking
4. **Reporter**: Quick win with existing models
5. **WizardState**: Enhancement of existing dataclass

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Gradual Migration**: Keep dict interfaces while using models internally
2. **Feature Flags**: Allow switching between old/new implementations
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure no regressions
4. **Phased Rollout**: Deploy one component at a time
5. **Monitoring**: Track any performance impacts
