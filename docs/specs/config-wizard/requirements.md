# Browser Pilot Configuration Wizard Requirements

**Date**: January 28, 2025
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for an interactive CLI configuration wizard that simplifies Browser Pilot setup for QA engineers. The wizard will guide users through all configuration steps with smart defaults and validation, eliminating the need for manual configuration file editing or command memorization.

## Goals

1. **Zero-to-Testing in < 2 minutes** - From fresh install to running first test
2. **No Prior Knowledge Required** - Works for users who don't know about ModelForge or LLM providers
3. **Smart Defaults** - One-key setup with sensible defaults
4. **Validation at Each Step** - Ensure configuration works before saving
5. **Seamless Integration** - Works with existing configuration system

## User Stories

### US-001: First-Time User Setup
**As a** QA engineer new to Browser Pilot
**I want** a guided setup process
**So that** I can start testing without reading documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Wizard launches automatically on first run if no config exists
- Can also be triggered with `browser-pilot --setup-wizard`
- Guides through provider selection, model choice, and browser config
- Tests configuration before saving
- Shows clear success message with next steps

### US-002: Reconfiguration
**As an** existing Browser Pilot user
**I want** to easily change my configuration
**So that** I can switch providers or update settings

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Wizard shows current values as defaults
- Can navigate with arrow keys to change selections
- Only modified values are updated
- Backup of previous config is created

### US-003: GitHub Copilot Priority
**As a** user without API keys
**I want** GitHub Copilot suggested first
**So that** I can use Browser Pilot without additional setup

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- GitHub Copilot always appears first in provider list
- Other providers sorted alphabetically after
- Clear indication that GitHub Copilot requires no API key

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Interactive Navigation
- **Arrow Keys**: Up/Down to navigate choices
- **Enter**: Select current choice
- **Tab**: Accept default and move to next field
- **Esc**: Cancel wizard (with confirmation)
- **Ctrl+C**: Exit wizard (with confirmation)

```

#### Step 3: Model Selection
```
Select model for github_copilot:

❯ gpt-4o            (Recommended - Best performance)
  gpt-4             (Previous generation)
  gpt-3.5-turbo     (Faster, lower cost)
  claude-3-sonnet   (Alternative model)

[Use arrows to move, Enter to select]
```

#### Step 4: Authentication (if needed)
```
GitHub Copilot requires authentication.

1. Go to: https://github.com/login/device
2. Enter code: XXXX-XXXX
3. Authorize the application

Waiting for authorization... ⣾

✅ Authentication successful!
```

#### Step 5: Browser Selection
```
Select your preferred browser:

❯ chromium    (Recommended - Best compatibility)
  chrome      (Google Chrome)
  firefox     (Mozilla Firefox)
  safari      (macOS only)
  edge        (Microsoft Edge)

[Use arrows to move, Enter to select]
```

#### Step 6: Test Mode
```
Default test execution mode:

❯ headless    (Faster, no browser window)
  headed      (See browser actions)

[Use arrows to move, Enter to select]
```

#### Step 7: Token Optimization
```
Token optimization level:

❯ medium      (Balanced - 20% reduction)
  high        (Maximum savings - 30% reduction)
  low         (Conservative - 10% reduction)
  none        (No optimization)

[Use arrows to move, Enter to select]
```

#### Step 8: Configuration Test
```
🔍 Testing your configuration...

✓ Connecting to github_copilot...
✓ Model gpt-4o is available
✓ Sending test prompt...
✓ Response received successfully
✓ Browser chromium is installed

✅ Configuration test passed!
```

#### Step 9: Save Configuration
```
Configuration Summary:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Provider:        github_copilot
Model:           gpt-4o
Browser:         chromium
Mode:            headless

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Save this configuration? [Y/n]: 
```

#### Step 10: Next Steps
```
🎉 Setup Complete!

You're ready to start testing. Try:

1. Quick test:
   browser-pilot --quick-test

2. Run an example:
   browser-pilot examples/google-ai-search.md

3. Create your own test:
   echo "Navigate to example.com and verify the title" | browser-pilot -

Need help? Run: browser-pilot --help
```

### FR-003: Dynamic Model Filtering
- Models list updates based on selected provider
- Only compatible models shown for each provider
- Model descriptions include context window size

### FR-004: Validation
- Test each configuration before proceeding
- Show clear error messages with solutions
- Allow retry on failure
- Skip to next step if validation passes

### FR-005: Error Handling
```
❌ Configuration test failed

Error: Unable to connect to openai
Reason: Invalid API key

Solutions:
1. Check your API key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Set environment variable: export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
