# Custom Exceptions - Requirements

## 1. Overview

This document defines requirements for implementing a custom exception hierarchy in Browser Copilot to replace generic exceptions with domain-specific ones that provide better context and debugging information.

## 2. Goals

- **Improve Error Clarity**: Users and developers get specific, actionable error messages
- **Enable Better Debugging**: Include context information in all exceptions
- **Enhance User Experience**: Provide helpful suggestions for common errors
- **Strengthen Error Handling**: Consistent error patterns across codebase

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Exception Hierarchy (EXC-001)
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)

Create a base exception class and domain-specific subclasses:
- Base class `BrowserPilotError` with context and suggestion support
- Specific exceptions for each error domain (configuration, execution, etc.)
- Proper exception chaining to preserve stack traces

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Base exception class implemented with context dict
- [ ] At least 10 specific exception types defined
- [ ] All exceptions support optional suggestions
- [ ] Exception messages are user-friendly

### 3.2 Context Information (EXC-002)
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)

Every exception must include relevant context:
- What operation was being performed
- What data was being processed
- Environmental information (paths, config values)
- Timestamp of occurrence

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Context dict parameter in all exceptions
- [ ] Context automatically serializable to JSON
- [ ] No sensitive data in context (passwords, keys)
- [ ] Context helps identify root cause

### 3.3 Actionable Suggestions (EXC-003)
**Priority**: P1 (High)

Exceptions should guide users to solutions:
- Common fixes for known issues
- Links to documentation when relevant
- Command examples for fixes
- Next steps to try

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] 80% of user-facing exceptions have suggestions
- [ ] Suggestions are specific and actionable
- [ ] No generic "contact support" messages
- [ ] Suggestions tested for accuracy

### 3.4 Error Categories (EXC-004)
**Priority**: P1 (High)

Define clear exception categories:
- Configuration errors
- Authentication/authorization errors
- Browser operation errors
- Test parsing errors
- Resource errors (file, network)
- Validation errors

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Each category has dedicated exception class
- [ ] Categories cover all error scenarios
- [ ] Clear inheritance hierarchy
- [ ] Consistent naming convention

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance (EXC-NFR-001)
- Exception creation overhead < 1ms
- Context serialization < 5ms
- No memory leaks from exception objects

### 4.2 Compatibility (EXC-NFR-002)
- Works with Python 3.11+ exception features
- Compatible with async/await error handling
- Integrates with existing logging

### 4.3 Maintainability (EXC-NFR-003)
- Clear documentation for each exception type
- Examples for when to use each exception
- Guidelines for adding new exceptions

## 5. Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Cannot break existing error handling
- Must not expose sensitive information
- Should not require changes to public APIs

## 6. Dependencies

- No new external dependencies
- Uses Python standard library only
- Compatible with existing type system

## 7. Migration Requirements

### 7.1 Gradual Migration
- Old exceptions deprecated, not removed
- Warning period for deprecated exceptions
- Clear migration guide provided

### 7.2 Code Updates
- Update one module at a time
- Maintain tests during migration
- No breaking changes to error contracts

## 8. Testing Requirements

### 8.1 Unit Tests
- Test each exception type
- Verify context preservation
- Check suggestion formatting
- Validate inheritance chain

### 8.2 Integration Tests
- Exceptions properly caught and logged
- Error messages reach users correctly
- Context available in logs

## 9. Success Metrics

- 100% of generic exceptions replaced
- 90% reduction in "unhelpful error" complaints
- 50% faster root cause identification
- Zero sensitive data leaks in errors

## 10. Acceptance Criteria

The feature is complete when:
- [ ] All exception classes implemented
- [ ] 100% test coverage on exception module
- [ ] All generic exceptions replaced
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Migration guide published
- [ ] No regression in error handling
