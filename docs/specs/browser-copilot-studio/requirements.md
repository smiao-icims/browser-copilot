# Browser Copilot Studio - High Level Specification

## Vision
Browser Copilot Studio is an interactive CLI-based test automation environment where QA engineers can design, execute, debug, and maintain test suites through natural language conversations with an AI agent, while seeing real-time browser interactions.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Interactive REPL for QA
- Launch with `browser-copilot studio`
- Persistent session with browser always visible
- Multi-turn conversation flow
- Context-aware assistance

### 2. Test Design Mode
- Start new test suite: `new test "user login flow"`
- Step-by-step test creation with AI guidance
- Real-time browser preview of each step
- Natural language to test step translation
- Immediate validation of selectors and actions

### 3. Test Execution Mode
- Run entire suite: `run test "user login flow"`
- Step through tests: `step` command
- Set breakpoints: `break at step 5`
- Interactive debugging with HIL
- Modify steps during execution

### 4. Test Maintenance Mode
- Update existing tests: `edit test "user login flow"`
- AI-assisted selector updates when UI changes
- Bulk updates across multiple tests
- Version control integration

## Key Features

### 1. Conversational Test Design
```
Engineer: "I want to test the login flow"
Copilot: "I'll help you create a login test. What's the URL of your login page?"
Engineer: "https://app.example.com/login"
Copilot: [navigates browser] "I see the login page. What credentials should I use?"
Engineer: "Use test@example.com and password123"
Copilot: "I'll add steps to enter credentials. Should I also test invalid login?"
```

### 2. Live Browser Integration
- Browser window stays open during entire session
- See exactly what the AI sees
- Point-and-click element selection
- Visual feedback for actions
- Screenshot annotations

### 3. Smart Test Generation
- AI suggests edge cases
- Automatic wait strategies
- Smart selector generation
- Test data management
- Assertion recommendations

### 4. Debugging Features
- Pause at any step
- Inspect element properties
- Modify selectors on the fly
- Retry failed steps
- Time-travel debugging

### 5. Test Suite Management
- List all tests: `list tests`
- Search tests: `find tests with "login"`
- Run test sets: `run tag:smoke`
- Test dependencies
- Parallel execution planning

## Technical Architecture

### 1. CLI Commands
- `studio` - Start interactive session
- `new test` - Create new test
- `run` - Execute tests
- `debug` - Debug mode
- `edit` - Modify tests
- `list` - Show available tests
- `help` - Context-aware help

### 2. State Management
- Persistent browser session
- Test context preservation
- Undo/redo capability
- Session recording
- Checkpoint system

### 3. Storage Format
- Tests saved as enhanced Markdown
- Metadata in frontmatter
- Version controlled
- Shareable test libraries
- Export to various formats

## User Workflows

### 1. New Test Creation
1. Launch studio
2. Describe test intent
3. AI guides through steps
4. Preview each action
5. Add assertions
6. Save and categorize

### 2. Test Debugging
1. Run test until failure
2. Enter debug mode
3. Inspect failure reason
4. Modify problematic step
5. Continue execution
6. Verify fix

### 3. Test Maintenance
1. AI detects broken tests
2. Suggests selector updates
3. Preview changes
4. Bulk apply fixes
5. Regression test
6. Commit changes

## Benefits
