# HIL Test: Exploration and Continuation Requests

This test triggers HIL through exploration and continuation questions.

## Test Steps:

1. Navigate to https://news.ycombinator.com
2. Find the top story on the page
3. Click on the top story link
4. Ask if the user would like to explore the comments or continue to the article
5. Based on the response, either:
   - Navigate to the article and summarize it
   - OR read the top comments
6. Ask if the user would like to explore more stories

## Expected HIL Triggers:

- Step 4: "Would you like me to read the comments or go to the full article?"
- Step 6: "Would you like to explore more stories from Hacker News?"

## Success Criteria:

- Hacker News loads successfully
- HIL requests are detected and handled automatically
- Navigation continues based on automated responses
- Test completes without manual intervention

## Notes:

This test simulates a common pattern where agents ask for direction when multiple valid paths exist.
