# Google AI Search Example

This example demonstrates how to use Google's AI-powered search to research any topic. The example shows searching for "EARS in software engineering" but can be adapted for any search query.

## Test: Research Using Google AI

### Test Parameters
- Search Query: "EARS Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax software engineering"
  (Replace with your own search term)

### Test Steps

1. Navigate to https://www.google.com
2. Wait for the page to load completely
3. Look for the "Search Labs" or "AI" button/icon (usually near the search bar)
4. Click on the AI mode toggle or "Try AI Overview" option
5. If prompted, accept any terms or click "Get started"
6. In the search box, type your search query
7. Press Enter to search
8. Wait for AI-generated response to appear
9. Verify the AI overview section appears at the top
10. Check that the AI response provides relevant information
11. Scroll down to see traditional search results
12. Take a screenshot of the AI response
13. Click on "Show more" or expand button if available to see full AI response

### Example Search Queries

```markdown
# Technical Topics
"Python async await best practices"
"Microservices vs monolithic architecture"
"Test-driven development benefits"

# Software Engineering Concepts  
"SOLID principles in object-oriented design"
"REST API design patterns"
"CI/CD pipeline best practices"

# AI and Machine Learning
"Transformer architecture in neural networks"
"Difference between supervised and unsupervised learning"
"RAG retrieval augmented generation explained"

# Development Tools
"Git rebase vs merge strategies"
"Docker compose vs Kubernetes"
"VS Code extensions for Python development"
```

### Expected AI Response Features

The AI response should typically include:
- **Summary**: Concise overview of the topic
- **Key Points**: Bullet points or numbered lists
- **Examples**: Code snippets or practical examples (when relevant)
- **Context**: Related concepts or background information
- **Sources**: Links to authoritative references

### Validation Points
- AI response appears before traditional search results
- Content is relevant to the search query
- Information is well-structured and easy to read
- Sources are credible and clickable
- Response length is appropriate for the topic

### Handling Different Scenarios

```markdown
# If AI mode is not available
- Continue with regular search
- Verify standard search results appear
- Note that AI features may be region-specific

# If login is required
- You may need to sign in to a Google account
- AI features might be in beta/preview

# For code-related searches
- Look for syntax highlighting in code examples
- Check if copy buttons are available for code snippets
```

### Notes
- Google AI features may require being logged in to a Google account
- AI mode availability varies by region and account settings
- Interface elements may change as Google updates the feature
- The AI response quality depends on the search query specificity
- Some queries may not trigger AI responses (very niche or new topics)
